Sticky spiced chicken wings
Recipe by Baby Sumo, adapted from Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Home Cooking
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 30-35 minutes
Serves 4


Ingredients
16 chicken wings

For the marinade
5 tbsp tamarind paste
2 tbsp cooking oil
2 tbsp palm sugar (gula melaka) or brown sugar
2 tbsp fish sauce
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/2 tsp chilli powder or flakes
1 tbsp light soy sauce
1/4 tsp coarse black pepper

1 1/2 - 2 tbsp gula melaka syrup, to glaze (optional)


1. Place marinade ingredients into a bowl, and mix well. Add chicken wings and using your hands, toss the wings, to ensure it is coated with marinade. Cover cling film and marinate overnight in the fridge, or at least 1 hour.

2. Preheat oven to 180°C (roast mode). Line a baking tray with tin foil. Arrange chicken wings in a single layer in tray.

3. Roast for 15 minutes, then remove from oven. Brush gula melaka syrup glaze on one side, then place back in oven and roast for a further 7 minutes. Then, remove again from oven, turn the chicken over with tongs and brush with more glaze. Place back in oven for another 7-10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and sticky. I cooked mine for a total of 35 minutes.

4. Serve warm, with a salad.

Note: I increased fish sauce from original recipe from 1 tbsp to 2, reduced chilli flakes from 1 tsp to 1/2 tsp, added in black pepper and light soy sauce and extra glaze.
